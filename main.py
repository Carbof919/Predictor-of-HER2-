| CELL_LINE_NAME | GeneA | GeneB | GeneC | ... |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| AU565          | 2.34  | 1.11  | 3.50  | ... |
| SKBR3          | 1.02  | 0.88  | 2.79  | ... |

- The column with cell line names should be labeled something like `CELL_LINE_NAME`, `Cell Line`, or similar.
- Gene columns should match the required features for the selected drug.
